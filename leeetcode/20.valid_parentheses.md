### Problem Statement:
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.



**Solution Approach**

Certainly, I'd be happy to explain the solution approach step by step:

1. **Mapping Opening and Closing Brackets:**
   The solution starts by creating a dictionary called `mapping` that stores the correspondence between opening and closing brackets. This mapping is essential to quickly determine whether a closing bracket is valid by comparing it to the last element in the stack.

2. **Stack Initialization:**
   An empty list called `stack` is initialized. The stack will be used to keep track of the opening brackets encountered while traversing the input string.

3. **Loop Through Each Character in the String:**
   The solution iterates through each character `c` in the input string `s`.

4. **Checking for Opening Brackets:**
   If the current character `c` is an opening bracket (i.e., `c` is present in the `mapping` dictionary as a key), it means that a corresponding closing bracket is expected. Therefore, the corresponding closing bracket is obtained from the `mapping` dictionary and pushed onto the `stack`.

5. **Checking for Closing Brackets:**
   If the current character `c` is not an opening bracket, it is treated as a closing bracket. Here, two conditions are checked:
   - If the `stack` is empty, there is no corresponding opening bracket in the stack for the current closing bracket. In this case, the expression is not valid, and the function returns `False`.
   - If the `stack` is not empty, the last element (which should be the expected closing bracket) is popped from the `stack` and compared with the current closing bracket `c`. If they don't match, it means the closing bracket is in the wrong order, and the function returns `False`.

6. **Final Check and Return:**
   After traversing all characters in the string, the loop ends. The solution performs a final check to see if the `stack` is empty. If it is, all brackets have been properly matched and popped, so the expression is valid, and the function returns `True`. If the `stack` is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `False`.

In summary, the solution utilizes a stack to keep track of opening brackets encountered in the string. For each character, it pushes corresponding closing brackets onto the stack and verifies the order of closing brackets by comparing them with the last element in the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, the expression is valid. Otherwise, it's not valid.



```python
def is_valid_parentheses(s):
  mapping = {
    '(': ')',
    '[': ']',
    '{': '}'
  }
  
  stack = []
  
  for c in s:
    if c in mapping:
      stack.append(mapping[c])
    elif not stack or c != stack.pop():
      return False
  
  return len(stack) == 0
```



**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this solution is O(n). 
- The solution iterates through each character of the input string `s`.
- For each character, the solution performs constant-time operations, such as dictionary lookups, appending to the stack, popping from the stack, and comparisons.
- Since each character is processed only once, the time complexity of the loop is linear, i.e., O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this solution is O(n). 
- The solution utilizes a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
- In the worst case, when all characters are opening brackets (e.g., `((((`), the stack could contain all `n` characters.
- Additionally, the `mapping` dictionary contains a fixed number of entries (3 pairs of opening and closing brackets), so its space usage is constant.
- Therefore, the space complexity is primarily determined by the stack, which can take up to `n` space in the worst case.
- Hence, the space complexity of the solution is O(n).
