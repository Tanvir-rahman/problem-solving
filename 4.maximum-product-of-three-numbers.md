**Problem Statement**

Given an integer array nums, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3]
Output: -6
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000



**Solution Explanation**

1. **Sort the List**: `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
2. **Calculate Products**: Two products are calculated:
   - `nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1]`: This is the product of the three smallest numbers.
   - `nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3]`: This is the product of the three largest numbers.
3. **Return Maximum Product**: The `max` function returns the larger of the two products.

### Why Both Products?
- The product of the three largest numbers makes sense when looking for the maximum product.
- But why the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number? This accounts for the possibility that the two smallest numbers could be negative, and their product might be positive. Since the list is sorted, if there are large negative numbers in the list, they would be at the beginning, and their product with the largest positive number could yield the maximum product.


```python
def maximumProduct(nums):
  """
  :type nums: List[int]
  :rtype: int
  """
  nums.sort()
  return max(nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1], nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3])
```


### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the sorting algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` list.

It comes from the sorting step in the code. The built-in `sort` method in Python typically uses an algorithm called Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.

Here's a breakdown of why Timsort has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\):

1. **Dividing the List**: The list is divided into small chunks. If the list has \(n\) elements, you can divide it into \(\log n\) levels.
2. **Sorting Small Chunks**: Small chunks can be sorted using insertion sort in linear time.
3. **Merging Chunks**: The sorted chunks are merged using a merge-like operation. Since there are \(\log n\) levels, and each merge operation takes \(O(n)\) time, the total time for merging is \(O(n \log n)\).

So the overall time complexity of the sorting step is \(O(n \log n)\), which dominates the time complexity of the entire function.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the code is \(O(1)\), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the products and return the result. The sorting operation is done in-place, so it doesn't require additional space.
