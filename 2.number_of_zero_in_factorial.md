**Problem Statement**

The problem at hand is to determine the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`. The factorial of `n` (denoted by `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

For instance, given `n = 5`, the factorial is `5*4*3*2*1 = 120`. Here, the number of trailing zeroes is `1`.

**Solution Explanation**

The Python function `findZeroes(n)` solves this problem efficiently by calculating the number of factors of 5 in `n!`. The logic behind this is that a trailing zero is produced by a multiplication of 2 and 5. Because factorials have more factors of 2 than 5, counting the number of factors of 5 is enough to know the number of trailing zeroes.

The algorithm starts with `i = 5` and continues until `i` is greater than `n`. In each iteration of the loop, it adds the integer division of `n` by `i` to the count and multiplies `i` by 5.

```python
def findTrailingZeroes(n):
    i = 5
    count = 0
    while (i <= n):
        count = count + int(n / i)
        i *= 5
    return count
```

**Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)) base 5. This is because the function performs a loop that continues until `i` (which starts at 5 and is multiplied by 5 at each step) becomes greater than `n`.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as the space used does not grow with the size of the input integer `n`. There are only two variables used (i.e., `count` and `i`), and no additional data structures like arrays or lists are used that would increase with `n`.

So in terms of complexity, this is an efficient algorithm to solve the problem of finding the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.
