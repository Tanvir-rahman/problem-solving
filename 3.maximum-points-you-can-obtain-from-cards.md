**Problem Statement**

Given an integer array A of size N.

You have to pick exactly B elements from either left or right end of the array A to get the maximum sum.

Find and return this maximum possible sum.

NOTE: Suppose B = 4 and array A contains 10 elements then

You can pick the first four elements or can pick the last four elements or can pick 1 from the front and 3 from the back etc. you need to return the maximum possible sum of elements you can pick.

**Solution Explanation**

Given an array (like a row of cards with different values) and you're allowed to pick a certain number of cards (let's say B) from either end (left or right) of the array. Your goal is to maximize the total value of the cards you've picked.

Here's how we simplify this:

1. **Start from one end:** Initially, you take the first B cards from the left end and calculate their total value.

2. **Slide towards the other end:** Imagine you're moving one step towards the right end. To do this, you have to drop the leftmost card you have picked and pick the next card from the right end. This gives you a new total value.

3. **Keep moving and updating:** Continue this process (dropping a card from the left and picking a new one from the right) and each time calculate the new total value. If this new value is higher than your previous total, then update it.

4. **Final result:** Keep moving and updating your total value until you have considered all possible ways to pick B cards from either end. The highest total value you have got in this process is your answer.

In this way, we don't need to consider every possible combination of cards from either end separately, which would be quite complicated and time-consuming. Instead, we use a smart way to 'slide' from one end to the other, keeping track of the best total value found so far.
 
```python

A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
B = 3

def solve(A, B):
    maxSum = sum(A[:B])
    tempSum = maxSum

    for i in range(1, B+1):
        tempSum = tempSum - A[B - i] + A[-i]
        maxSum = max(maxSum, tempSum)

    return maxSum

print(solve(A,B))
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(B). 

The reason behind this is that we are running a single loop that iterates B times. First, we calculate the sum of the first B elements (which takes B operations), then we iterate over the next B elements, each time subtracting an element from the beginning and adding an element from the end (which takes another B operations). Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to B, so the time complexity is O(B).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of this solution is O(1).

We are using only a fixed amount of extra space in the algorithm. The extra space used (for the variables `temp_sum` and `max_sum`) does not increase with the size of the input array A or the value of B. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, which is denoted as O(1).

So, this solution is efficient as it has a linear time complexity and constant space complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs well without using much computational resources.
