**Problem Statement**

Given an integer array A of size N.

You need to check that whether there exist a element which is strictly greater than all the elements on left of it and strictly smaller than all the elements on right of it.

If it exists return 1 else return 0.

NOTE:

Do not consider the corner elements i.e A[0] and A[N-1] as the answer.


Problem Constraints
3 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109

Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 8, 10, 7, 9]
Input 2:

 A = [5, 1, 4, 4]


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


**Solution Explanation**
Certainly! Let's explain the solution in an even simpler way.

The function is trying to find a "perfect peak" in the given list. A "perfect peak" is a number that is larger than all the numbers before it and smaller than all the numbers after it in the list.

1. **Find the maximum number from the start to each position**: Go through the list from left to right and store the maximum number you've seen so far at each position in a list called `max_left`.

2. **Find the minimum number from the end to each position**: Go through the list from right to left and store the minimum number you've seen so far at each position in a list called `min_right`.

3. **Check for a perfect peak**: Go through the list again, starting from the second number and ending with the second to last number. Check if any number is greater than the maximum number before it (`max_left[i - 1]`) and smaller than the minimum number after it (`min_right[i]`).

4. **Return the result**: If you find a perfect peak, return 1. If not, return 0.

### Example:

If the list is `[5, 10, 7, 8, 6]`, the function will work like this:

1. `max_left` will be `[5, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
2. `min_right` will be `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`.
3. It will then check the numbers in the middle of the list (10, 7, and 8), but none of them is greater than the maximum number before it and smaller than the minimum number after it.
4. Since no perfect peak is found, the function will return 0.


```python
def perfectPeak(A):
    n = len(A)
    max_left = [0] * n
    min_right = [0] * n

    max = A[0]
    min = A[n - 1]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if A[i - 1] > max:
            max = A[i - 1]
        max_left[i - 1] = max
        if A[n - i] < min:
            min = A[n - i]
        min_right[n - i - 1] = min

    for i in range(1, n):
        if max_left[i - 1] < A[i] < min_right[i]:
            return 1
    return 0
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array `A`. This is because both the calculations of `max_left` and `min_right`, as well as the final check for the perfect peak, are done with simple iterations through the array.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) because two additional arrays of size \( n \) (`max_left` and `min_right`) are created to store intermediate values.
